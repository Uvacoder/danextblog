# DANEXTBLOG ðŸ˜Ž

Blog site to share practical tutorials along with working code samples and boilerplate projects for real-world web development problems that we run into in our day to day work. The tutorials are concise as possible, focusing on the code, structure and functionality, while trying to leave out extra fluff or info that isn't useful.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Still a work in progress...
